The '''2008 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] to determine the national champion of men's [[NCAA Division I]]&nbsp;[[college basketball]] as a culmination of the [[2007–08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007–08 basketball season]]. It began on March 18, 2008, and concluded on April 7 at the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]].

For the first time since seeding began, all four of the top seeds advanced to the Final Four. These were [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]], the winner of the South region, [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]], the winner of the West region making their third consecutive Final Four appearance, [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], the winner of the Midwest region, and overall number one seed and East region winner [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], back in the Final Four for the first time since their 2005 national championship.<ref name="NCAA Championship Information">{{cite web | url= http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/schedules | title=NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Information | accessdate=2006-07-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060719233440/http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/schedules| archivedate= 19 July 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="2008 NCAA tournament selections">{{cite web | url= http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/ncaatourney08/news/story?id=3296729 | title=2008 NCAA tournament selections | accessdate=2016-02-17<!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

Memphis and Kansas advanced to the national championship game, with Memphis's victory in the semifinals giving them a record-setting 38 for the season, beating the mark set by [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] in 1999 ([[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] later matched this record in 2012 and 2015).  Kansas, however, spoiled their national championship hopes by handing the Tigers their second loss of the season, winning the game in overtime, 75-68.  Memphis's entire season was later vacated by the NCAA due to eligibility concerns surrounding freshman guard [[Derrick Rose]].<ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/story/13098232/ncaa-rejects-memphis-final-appeal-of-vacated-wins?tag=headlines;other NCAA rejects Memphis's final appeal of vacated wins]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202112400/http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/story/13098232/ncaa-rejects-memphis-final-appeal-of-vacated-wins?tag=headlines%3Bother |date=February 2, 2014 }}, cbssports.com, retrieved 2010-03-22</ref>

Entering the tournament on March 18, the top ranked team was [[2007–08 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] in both the [[AP Top 25]] and the [[Coaches' Poll|ESPN/USA Today Coaches']] Polls, followed by [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]], [[2007–08 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] and [[2007–08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]].

[[American University]] (Patriot), [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County|UMBC]] (America East), [[University of Texas at Arlington|Texas-Arlington]] (Southland), and [[Portland State]] (Big Sky) all entered the tournament for the first time in their school's history. Another school, [[Coppin State]] won the MEAC Tournament to become the first 20-loss school ever to make the field. [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]], a team that otherwise would not have advanced to the tournament, [[Georgia Bulldogs basketball#2008 SEC Tournament: The Dream Dawgs|won the SEC tournament]] to qualify, and were awarded a #14 seed, the lowest-ever by a major conference team in the tournament.

Whereas the 2007 tournament did not see many upsets, the 2008 tournament was full of them. The sub-regional pod played at the [[St. Pete Times Forum]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] featured four games where a double digit seed won. #5 seeds [[Drake Bulldogs men's basketball|Drake]] and [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Clemson]] fell to #12 seeds [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers men's basketball|Western Kentucky]] and [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] while the #4 seeds in that same pod, [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt]] and [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]], were defeated by #13 seeds [[Siena Saints men's basketball|Siena]] and [[San Diego Toreros men's basketball|San Diego]]. Western Kentucky advanced to the West regional in Phoenix where they lost to UCLA while Villanova was one of two double digit seeds to advance to the Midwest regional. The other was #10 seed [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson]], who rode the hot shooting of [[Stephen Curry (basketball)|Stephen Curry]] to defeat [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], and [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]] before nearly upsetting Kansas in the regional final. The Midwest region alone saw four of its double digit seeds advance, as in addition to Villanova, Siena, and Davidson #11 seed [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]] knocked off #6 seed [[USC Trojans men's basketball|USC]].

The total tournament attendance of 763,607 set a record for highest total tournament attendance, breaking the record set during the [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999 tournament]].

{{details|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Tournament format}}

The NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship is an annual single-elimination tournament featuring 65 teams representing all Division I Conferences in the nation. A "play-in" game determined which of the two lowest seeds would play in the first round of 64 against a top seed team. The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 65 within four regionals of 16 teams; Mount St. Mary's, as the winner of the play-in game, automatically received a 16 seed. The first and second-round games were played at the following sites, which were not restricted to any one particular Tournament Region, because of the "pod system":<ref name="NCAA Championship Information"/>
;March 20 and 22
:[[Honda Center]], [[Anaheim, California]] (Host: [[Big West Conference]])
:[[Pepsi Center]], [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]] (Hosts: [[Colorado State University]] and [[Mountain West Conference]])
:[[CenturyLink Center Omaha|Qwest Center Omaha]], [[Omaha, Nebraska]] (Hosts: [[Creighton University]] and [[Missouri Valley Conference]])
:[[Capital One Arena|Verizon Center]], [[Washington, D.C.]] (Host: [[Georgetown University]])
;March 21 and 23
:[[Birmingham Jefferson Convention Complex|BJCC Arena]], [[Birmingham, Alabama]] (Host: [[Southeastern Conference]])
:[[Verizon Arena|Alltel Arena]], [[North Little Rock, Arkansas]] (Host: [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]])
:[[PNC Arena|RBC Center]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] (Host: [[North Carolina State University]])
:[[Amalie Arena|St. Pete Times Forum]], [[Tampa, Florida]] (Host: [[University of South Florida]])

The four regionals are officially named after their geographic areas, a practice that resumed in 2007. Between 2004 and 2006, the regionals were named for their host cities. The following arenas/stadia and cities were the sites for the 2008 regionals:<ref name="NCAA Championship Information"/>
;March 27 and 29
:'''East Regional''', [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Charlotte Bobcats Arena]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] (Host: [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]])
:'''West Regional''', [[Talking Stick Resort Arena|US Airways Center]], [[Phoenix, Arizona]] (Host: [[Arizona State University]])

;March 28 and 30
:'''Midwest Regional''', [[Ford Field]], [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] (Host: [[University of Detroit Mercy]])
:'''South Regional''', [[NRG Stadium|Reliant Stadium]], [[Houston|Houston, Texas]] (Hosts: [[University of Houston]] and [[Rice University]])

Each regional winner advanced to the [[Final Four]].
;April 5 and 7
:[[Alamodome]], [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]] (Host: [[University of Texas at San Antonio]])<ref name="NCAA Championship Information"/>

For the third time, the Alamodome and the city of San Antonio hosted the Final Four, something it will do once more in 2018. The tournament featured five new buildings and two new host cities. For the first time ever, the tournament was played within the city of Detroit at Ford Field, the [[Detroit Lions]]' home stadium. Previous games in the Detroit area had been played at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] and [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], both in the suburbs. For the first, and to date only, time, the tournament was held in the state of Arkansas at the Alltel Arena, located in North Little Rock and the state's second largest indoor venue after [[Bud Walton Arena]] on the campus of the [[University of Arkansas]]. For the first time since 1977, the tournament returned to Nebraska's largest city, this time at the new Qwest Center Omaha, the off-campus home of the [[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|Creighton Bluejays]]. The tournament also returned to Houston for the first time since 1986, this time at Reliant Stadium, the [[Houston Texans]]' home stadium. This marked the fifth different venue in the city of Houston to host games, a record tied in 2017 by Indianapolis, but which will be overtaken by Houston once more in 2020 when the [[Toyota Center]] is scheduled to host games. And finally, the Charlotte Bobcats Arena became the third arena in the city of Charlotte to host games, replacing the [[Charlotte Coliseum]] and [[Bojangles' Coliseum]]. To date, this tournament also marks the most recent appearance of the BJCC Arena (now known as Legacy Arena), a ten-time host to tournament games.

===Listed by grouping and seeding===
A total of 31 teams received automatic bids for winning their conference tournament championship. Since the Ivy League does not hold a tournament, its regular season champion received the automatic bid. This left 34 at-large bids to be decided from the rest of the field by the NCAA Selection Committee. The at-large bids, along with the seeding for each team in the tournament, were announced on Sunday, March 16.<ref>[http://www.ticketsolutions.com/ncaa-selection.asp NCAA Tournament Selection Information from Ticket Solutions: Picking The Field] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517083543/http://www.ticketsolutions.com/ncaa-selection.asp |date=May 17, 2008 }}, ticketsolutions.com, retrieved 2008-03-22</ref> Coppin State was the first team to make the tournament with 20&nbsp;losses.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3296941&categoryId=2459792 Breaking Down the East Region] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319103936/http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3296941&categoryId=2459792 |date=March 19, 2008 }}, [[ESPN]] Video, retrieved 2008-03-22</ref> Maryland-Baltimore County, American, Texas-Arlington, and Portland State all received their first tournament bids in school history.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280762466 ESPN - Texas-Arlington vs. Northwestern State - Recap - March 16, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319000000/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280762466 |date=March 19, 2008 }}, [[ESPN]], retrieved 2008-03-22</ref><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280722502 ESPN - Northern Arizona vs. Portland State - Recap - March 12, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021522/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280722502 |date=April 11, 2016 }}, [[ESPN]], retrieved 2008-03-22</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3297006&n8pe6c=1&categoryId=2459792 Breaking Down the Midwest Region] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325052118/http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3297006&n8pe6c=1&categoryId=2459792 |date=March 25, 2008 }}, [[ESPN]] Video, retrieved 2008-03-22</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280740044 ESPN - Colgate vs. American University - Recap - March 14, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115004228/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280740044 |date=January 15, 2016 }}, [[ESPN]], retrieved 2008-03-22</ref> Four teams returned after absences from the NCAA Tournament of 20 years or more—Drake (last appearing in [[1971 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1971]]),<ref name="MVC final">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280692181 |title=Drake pummels Illinois State, sweeps MVC titles |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2008-03-09 |accessdate=2008-03-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080313014621/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280692181| archivedate= 13 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Cal State Fullerton ([[1978 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978]]),<ref name="Big West final">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280752239 |title=Big West win puts Cal State Fullerton in NCAA tourney for first time since '78 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2008-03-15 |accessdate=2008-03-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080320235535/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280752239| archivedate= 20 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Cornell ([[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1988]]),<ref name="Ivy clinched">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280610172 |title=Gore, Wittman will Cornell into Big Dance with first Ivy League title in 20 years |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2008-03-01 |accessdate=2008-03-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080305135452/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280610172| archivedate= 5 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and Baylor (1988).<ref name="Baylor v Purdue">{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/preview?gameId=284000039 | title=Baylor vs. Purdue: Preview | date=2008-03-20 | accessdate=2008-06-09 | publisher=''ESPNcom''}}</ref>

====Second round====
Washington State, the region's fourth seed, was first to earn a spot in the [[Charlotte Bobcats Arena|Charlotte, North Carolina]] East Regional by handily beating fifth-seeded Notre Dame, 61-41 in [[Pepsi Center|Denver, Colorado]]. The rout came as a shock to many sportscasters, who expected Notre Dame's offense, which was averaging about 80 points a game, to outdo the Cougars. Instead, Notre Dame shot 24% from the field, their worst offensive effort since 1983 and the fifth-worst in the history of the NCAA tournament's opening rounds. Washington State's win brought them to their first-ever trip to the Sweet 16. Top-seeded North Carolina will challenge the Cougars after defeating Arkansas, the ninth seed, 108-77. The win marked only the third time the Tar Heels had won their first two tournament games by more than 20 points. The other two UNC teams to do this, in 1993 and 2005, went on to win the championship. With the win, North Carolina also set a school record for wins in a season, with 34.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000049 ESPN - Arkansas vs. North Carolina - Recap - March 23, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021537/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000049 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref> Second-seeded Tennessee survived an upset bid from number seven seed Butler, winning in overtime 76-71.

====Second round====
Third-seeded Stanford saw [[Brook Lopez]] make the difference in overtime with a basket with 1.3 seconds left to beat Marquette 82-81 and advance to [[Reliant Stadium|Houston, Texas]]. Stanford coach [[Trent Johnson]] was ejected in the first half, and Stanford had to fight a six-point deficit at halftime to come back for the win.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000025 ESPN - Marquette vs. Stanford - Recap - March 22, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021557/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000025 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref> Michigan State became the first lower seed to win in the region, with a 65-54 victory over Pittsburgh.

====Regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen)====
Tens of thousands of Texas fans turned out to Reliant Stadium in Houston and saw the second seeded Longhorns defeat the number three seeded Stanford Cardinal, 82-62. The unlikely defensive star of the game was Texas' [[Dexter Pittman]]. Normally not even a starter, Pittman was effective on the court, throwing his size against the tall Lopez twins, high-scorers at Stanford. On the offensive end, [[D. J. Augustin]] scored twenty-three points to combine with [[Damion James]]' 18 for the win. Stanford made things close at about the 13 minute mark of the second half, bringing it to within one at 52-51, but Texas went on a 16-2 run and turned the game into a rout.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000029 ESPN - Stanford vs. Texas - Recap - March 28, 2008<!-- reflinks title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021558/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000029 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref> Later in the day, top-seeded Memphis defeated fifth seed Michigan State, 92-74. Memphis entered the game as the favorite but with several commentators pointing to them as the top seed most likely to lose. Instead, the Tigers went into halftime with a 30-point lead. Derrick Rose led his team with 27 points, and [[Chris Douglas-Roberts]] followed with 25, while Spartan star [[Drew Neitzel]] was held to just six.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=284000022 ESPN - Michigan State vs. Memphis - Box Score - March 28, 2008<!-- reflinks title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021558/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=284000022 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref>

====First round====
In the West Region, with a pod in Tampa as well, WKU entering as the 12th seed, defeated fifth seeded Drake in overtime 101-99. Drake had come back from sixteen down in the final eight minutes, bringing the game to overtime, and were ahead with 5.7 seconds left.

The second semifinal was a highly anticipated matchup between North Carolina Head Coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] and the team he had coached for 15 years before leaving to go to UNC. The game itself could be divided up as if it were three different games. The Jayhawks took a 40-12 lead in the first 15 minutes, causing CBS analyst Billy Packer to declare that the game was over. North Carolina narrowed the deficit to 17 at halftime on a 15-4 run and opened the second half on a 23-10 run to close to within 4 points with 11 minutes to play. After the teams traded baskets for a few minutes, Kansas pulled away, closing on a 20-7 run for an 84-66 victory. After Kansas went out to the 40-12 lead, North Carolina never held the ball with a chance to take the lead.  Brandon Rush led the Jayhawks with 25 points. AP Player of the Year Tyler Hansbrough scored 17 points and had 9 rebounds, both below his season averages. The Tar Heels were led by Wayne Ellington's 18 points.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000031 ESPN - Kansas vs. North Carolina - Recap - April 05, 2008<!-- reflinks title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021959/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000031 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref>

The National Championship Game pitted [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]] against [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]]. The head coaches (KU's [[Bill Self]] and Memphis' [[John Calipari]]) had both been on the coaching staff of Kansas' 1986 Final Four team.  Neither had garnered a national championship to this point in their head coaching careers. Memphis guard [[Chris Douglas-Roberts]] had been the leading scorer in the tournament, averaging 23.6 points per game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/marchmadness/story/566220.html |title=Championship game has spotlight matchup |publisher=''Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' |accessdate=2008-04-06 |date=2008-04-06 |author=Barnhouse, Wendell |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724003954/http://www.star-telegram.com/marchmadness/story/566220.html |archivedate=July 24, 2008 }}</ref> Memphis became the first team currently from a [[College basketball#Conferences|conference]] other than the six majors to play in the championship game since 1998.

On the day of the game, the betting lines set by [[Las Vegas]] [[casino]]s [[Las Vegas Hilton]], [[Station Casinos]], and [[The Mirage]] made Memphis the favorite by a [[Spread betting|spread]] of 2 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegas.com/gaming/|title=Lines for:NCAA Basketball Current as of 04/07/2008 12:43:02|publisher=Vegas.com|accessdate=2008-04-07|date=2008-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080409050029/http://www.vegas.com/gaming/| archivedate= 9 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The first half was back-and-forth as Kansas led for 7:37 minutes and Memphis led for 6:51 minutes. Kansas led 33-28 at halftime, the first second-half deficit that Memphis faced in the entire tournament. Memphis scored the first five points of the second half to tie the score at 33 with 18:57 left in regulation. After that Kansas maintained a small lead from the 16:04 mark until Memphis retook the lead with 8:11 remaining. Memphis then went on a 10-0 run to build a seven-point lead with 5:10 remaining and increased it to nine points with 2:12 remaining in regulation.<ref name=playbyplay>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=284000063|title=Kansas vs. Memphis: Play by Play|publisher=''ESPN.com''|accessdate=2008-04-08|date=2008-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080412093412/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=284000063| archivedate= 12 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Kansas strategically fouled Memphis—an extremely poor free throw shooting team all season—which missed four of its final five free throws in regulation while Kansas furiously scored 12 points in the final two minutes of regulation. During that stretch Kansas made 100% of their shots going 2 for 2 from two point range, 2 for 2 from three point range and 2 for 2 from the free throw line.  When Memphis failed to foul, which arguably would have all but assured a victory for the Tigers, Kansas guard [[Mario Chalmers]] hit a three-point basket with 2.1 seconds remaining to tie the game at 63, sending the game into overtime. Kansas fans now refer to this shot as Mario's Miracle.<ref name=playbyplay/> At the end of regulation, the Jayhawks had led the score a total of 17:55 minutes and Memphis 15:51 minutes.

In overtime, Kansas scored the first six points en route to a 75-68 win. They continued the blistering stretch they started in regulation, going 4 of 6 from the field and 4 of 4 from the line in overtime.  It was KU's third NCAA title since the modern tournament began in 1939 (fifth national title overall, including two [[Helms Foundation|Helms decisions]]). It was also the first national championship for the program since the [[1987–88 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1988 team]].

This was the 7th overtime National Championship Game in NCAA Division I tournament history and first since 1997. It also represented the first national title for the [[Big 12 Conference]].

This national championship appearance by Memphis would later be vacated as a result of NCAA rules infractions.

==Media==

===Television===

====CBS Sports====
[[File:JimNantz2001.jpg|thumb|[[Jim Nantz]], CBS Sports television announcer for the 2008 Final Four along with [[Billy Packer]]]]
For the 27th consecutive year, [[CBS Sports]] telecast the tournament, and for the 18th consecutive year, broadcast every game in the main bracket from the first round to the championship, as [[Jim Nantz]] and [[Billy Packer]] called the Final Four. [[ESPN]] carried the 64th-seed Opening Round game between Coppin State and Mount St. Mary's on March 18, with [[Brent Musburger]], [[Steve Lavin]] and [[Erin Andrews]] serving as the announcing team, as the network has done the Opening Round game since 2002.

The complete list of announcing teams follows:

*[[Jim Nantz]], [[Billy Packer]] and [[Sam Ryan]] (she was only used as Sideline Reporter for the Final Four and NCAA Championship game) – First & Second Round at Raleigh, North Carolina; South Regional at Houston, Texas; Final Four at San Antonio, Texas
*[[Dick Enberg]]/[[Carter Blackburn]] and [[Jay Bilas]] – Blackburn Thursday afternoon; Enberg Thursday night, First & Second Round at Anaheim, California; East Regional at Charlotte, North Carolina
*[[Verne Lundquist]] and [[Bill Raftery]] – First & Second Round at Birmingham, Alabama; West Regional at Phoenix, Arizona
*[[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] and [[Len Elmore]] – First & Second Round at Denver, Colorado; Midwest Regional at Detroit, Michigan
*[[Kevin Harlan]] and [[Dan Bonner]] – First & Second Round at Omaha, Nebraska
*[[Ian Eagle]] and [[Jim Spanarkel]] – First & Second Round at Little Rock, Arkansas
*[[Craig Bolerjack]] and [[Bob Wenzel]] – First & Second Round at Washington, D.C.
*[[Tim Brando]] and [[Mike Gminski]] – First & Second Round at Tampa, Florida

[[Greg Gumbel]] once again served as the studio host, joined by analysts [[Clark Kellogg]] and [[Seth Davis]].  For the first time since the rights were acquired, the host team spent the entire tournament at the [[CBS Broadcast Center]] in New York City and did not travel to the Final Four site. CBS cited budget cutbacks ordered by the parent company, [[CBS Corporation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This would be Billy Packer's 35th and final tournament as a broadcaster, ending a streak that began in 1975; in July 2008, it was announced that Kellogg would replace Packer as Nantz's color man in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]].

Several affiliates showed additional games on digital subchannels, and once, the Los Angeles area had simultaneous telecasts on two stations: On March 20, UCLA vs. Mississippi Valley State was shown on [[KCBS-TV|KCBS]] and Cal State Fullerton vs. Wisconsin was on [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[KDOC-TV|KDOC]] at the same time.  (KCBS has a duopoly with [[KCAL-TV|KCAL]], but KCAL was unavailable because of a third basketball game, one between the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Utah Jazz]] in [[Salt Lake City]].)

====CBS College Sports Network====
Sibling cable network CBS College Sports Network (now known as [[CBS Sports Network]]) picked up one CBS TV broadcast on each of the first two days of the tournament. It aired the Stanford-Cornell contest from Anaheim on March 20, and the St. Joseph's-Oklahoma game on March 21.

Unlike CBS Sports on the broadcast side, CBS College Sports Network did send a team to San Antonio, with Blackburn anchoring coverage and hosting the postgame highlights show, called the ''NCAA March Madness Highlights Show''. Earlier, [[Greg Amsinger]] had hosted the postgame program from the network's studios at [[Chelsea Piers]] in [[lower Manhattan]]. Analysts included [[Steve Lappas]], [[Greg Anthony]], and [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jay Williams]].

===Radio===

<!--If you are aware of any tournament coverage by TV networks outside the United States, please include it in the subsection "Outside the U.S."-->

===Other media===
[[DirecTV]] once again offered [[NCAA Mega March Madness]] as a [[pay-per-view]] package for one payment of US$69. This allowed access to all tournament games in the first three rounds of the main draw not shown on the local CBS station in the viewer's area. This package was exclusive to DirecTV and not available to [[Dish Network]], [[FiOS|fiber optic]], or [[cable television|cable]] subscribers.

Online, [[CBSSports.com]] and NCAA.com teamed up for NCAA March Madness on Demand. Computer users with broadband connections were able to watch all tournament games from the first round to the championship game for free, thanks to advertiser support from [[Coca-Cola]], [[AT&T Mobility]], [[Pontiac]], and various other companies. The ads were not the same as those shown on television, and there was a separate halftime show hosted by Jason Horowitz joined by analysts including [[St. John's Red Storm|St. John's]] head basketball coach [[Norm Roberts]].
