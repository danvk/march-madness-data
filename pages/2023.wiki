The '''2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that determined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[college basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2022–23 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2022–23 season]]. The 84th annual edition of [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|the tournament]] began on March 14, 2023, and concluded with the [[2022–23 UConn Huskies men's basketball team|UConn Huskies]] defeating the [[2022-23 San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball team|San Diego State Aztecs]], 76–59 in the [[2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 3 at [[NRG Stadium]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chron.com/sports/college/article/Houston-to-host-Final-Four-in-2023-13079423.php |title=Houston To Host Final Four in 2023 |website=Chron.com |date=July 16, 2018 |access-date=July 16, 2018 |last=Duarte |first=Joseph |archive-date=July 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717143737/https://www.chron.com/sports/college/article/Houston-to-host-Final-Four-in-2023-13079423.php |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[ASUN Conference|ASUN]] champion [[2022–23 Kennesaw State Owls men's basketball team|Kennesaw State]] made its NCAA tournament debut, while [[Southern Conference]] champion [[2022–23 Furman Paladins men's basketball team|Furman]] made its first NCAA appearance since [[1980 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1980]]. Another school, [[2022–23 Texas Southern Tigers basketball team|Texas Southern]], won the [[2023 SWAC men's basketball tournament|SWAC tournament]] to become the third 20-loss team to make the field, after the [[2007-08 Coppin State Eagles men's basketball team|Coppin State Eagles]] in [[2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2008]] and [[2012–13 Liberty Flames basketball team|Liberty Flames]] in [[2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2013]].

This tournament featured several notable upsets. For only the second time in history, a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed, when [[2022–23 Fairleigh Dickinson Knights men's basketball team|Fairleigh Dickinson]] upset [[2022–23 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Purdue]] in the first round [[2023 Fairleigh Dickinson vs. Purdue men's basketball game|63–58]] in [[Nationwide Arena|Columbus]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Camargo |first=Alberto |date=March 17, 2023 |title=No. 16 FDU shocks No. 1 Purdue in first round of March Madness |publisher=NCAA |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2023-03-17/16-seed-fdu-shocks-1-seed-purdue-first-round-march-madness |url-status=live |access-date=March 18, 2023 |archive-date=March 18, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230318013821/https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2023-03-17/16-seed-fdu-shocks-1-seed-purdue-first-round-march-madness}}</ref> Coincidentally, much like [[2018 UMBC vs. Virginia men's basketball game|the previous time a top seed lost in Round 1]], the regional final was contested between a mid-major (in this case Florida Atlantic) and Kansas State. For the third consecutive year, and seventh time since [[2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2012]], a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed in the tournament, when 15-seeded [[2022–23 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team|Princeton]] defeated 2-seed [[2022–23 Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team|Arizona]] 59–55 in [[Golden 1 Center|Sacramento]] for the Tigers' first tournament win since [[1998 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1998]]. Arizona became the first team to lose to a 15-seed team twice, with the first loss being against the [[1992–93 Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball team|Santa Clara Broncos]] in [[1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1993]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/35874896/no-15-princeton-shocks-no-2-arizona-ncaa-tournament |title=No. 15 Princeton shocks No. 2 Arizona in NCAA tournament |first=Kyle |last=Bonagura |website=ESPN.com |date=March 16, 2023 |access-date=March 17, 2023 |archive-date=March 17, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230317000726/https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/35874896/no-15-princeton-shocks-no-2-arizona-ncaa-tournament |url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, Princeton subsequently defeated [[2022–23 Missouri Tigers men's basketball team|Missouri]] in the second round to advance to the Sweet 16, marking the third consecutive year where a 15-seed reach the regional semifinals.

The defending national champions [[2022–23 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas Jayhawks]] were eliminated in the second round, against the [[2022–23 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Arkansas Razorbacks]], becoming the sixth consecutive tournament where the defending champion failed to make the Sweet Sixteen.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bromberg |first1=Nick |title=March Madness Saturday recap: Kansas is the 6th straight men's defending champ to exit early |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/march-madness-saturday-recap-kansas-is-the-6th-straight-mens-defending-champ-to-exit-early-031709566.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHCng-sKwgtnvpGPMGCM3PzH2BMPJwm3GsJ9zo3MpdzpfKhfkW4M3zQiLbAsBOnAHdSln2jShR5Kk2p0PD6FDSFkpokrKHN4mq_GlBjGG9uACbGIYil9YHWR4canBvneDYqeCdYfyjFJXnrlZVAfT6XUaWcRky59GE0ljGzQl5Sc |work=Yahoo Sports |date=2023-03-18 |access-date=March 19, 2023 |archive-date=March 21, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321202337/https://sports.yahoo.com/march-madness-saturday-recap-kansas-is-the-6th-straight-mens-defending-champ-to-exit-early-031709566.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHCng-sKwgtnvpGPMGCM3PzH2BMPJwm3GsJ9zo3MpdzpfKhfkW4M3zQiLbAsBOnAHdSln2jShR5Kk2p0PD6FDSFkpokrKHN4mq_GlBjGG9uACbGIYil9YHWR4canBvneDYqeCdYfyjFJXnrlZVAfT6XUaWcRky59GE0ljGzQl5Sc |url-status=live }}</ref>

This was also the first NCAA tournament in which all of the top seeds failed to make the Elite Eight, after [[2022–23 Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team|Alabama]] and [[2022–23 Houston Cougars men's basketball team|Houston]]'s eliminations in the Sweet Sixteen.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bromberg |first1=Nick |title=March Madness: No. 5 Miami takes out No. 1 Houston to make NCAA tournament history |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/march-madness-no-5-miami-takes-out-no-1-houston-to-make-ncaa-tournament-history-012546053.html |website=Yahoo Sports |access-date=March 25, 2023 |date=March 24, 2023}}</ref> This year also had the fewest combined 1- and 2-seeds left in the Elite Eight in tournament history, with only 2-seed [[2022–23 Texas Longhorns men's basketball team|Texas]] remaining.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=John |title=Crazy Eight: No top seeds among last 8 in March Madness |url=https://apnews.com/article/march-madness-1-seeds-lose-43ad64a8c09ba95869520d4c7d7dda77 |work=The Associated Press |access-date=March 25, 2023 |date=March 25, 2023}}</ref>

For the first time since [[1970 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1970]], three teams made their first Final Four appearance in this tournament. Those three teams were [[2022–23 Florida Atlantic Owls men's basketball team|Florida Atlantic]], who defeated 3-seed [[2022–23 Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team|Kansas State]] to join [[2012–13 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|Wichita State]] as the only 9-seeds to advance to the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Russo |first1=Ralph D. |date=March 25, 2023 |title=FAU holds off Nowell and K-State to reach 1st Final Four |url=https://apnews.com/article/march-madness-florida-atlantic-kansas-state-84469e5033ceebe3bc557611c6b1aeea |access-date=March 26, 2023 |work=The Associated Press}}</ref> [[2022–23 San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball team|San Diego State]], and [[2022–23 Miami Hurricanes men's basketball team|Miami (FL)]], who both advanced to their first Final Four in program history.

With FAU ([[Conference USA]]) and SDSU ([[Mountain West Conference]]), the Final Four had two mid-major teams for the first time since 2011's Butler and VCU.

The 2023 Final Four was also marked by its lack of highly touted high school prospects. For the first time since the NCAA began seeding the tournament in 1979, no former [[McDonald's All-American Game|McDonald's All-American]] participated in the Final Four. Of the rotation players on the Final Four teams (those receiving regular playing time), the highest-ranked in the composite [[College recruiting|recruiting]] rankings of 247Sports was UConn's [[Jordan Hawkins]], who was #51 in the 2021 class. Only eight rotation players in the Final Four were even ranked in the top 100; by contrast, 12 players were unranked in high school. Two teams, Florida Atlantic and San Diego State, had no top-100 players, with FAU's nine-man rotation featuring six unranked players and only one in the top 200.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/2023-final-four-breaking-down-uconn-miami-san-diego-state-fau-by-recruiting-rankings/ |title=2023 Final Four: Breaking down UConn, Miami, San Diego State, FAU by recruiting rankings |first=David |last=Cobb |website=CBSSports.com |date=March 28, 2023 |access-date=March 29, 2023}}</ref>

For the second consecutive year, a school that won a conference championship was ineligible to compete in the NCAA tournament because they were in transition to Division I. Fairleigh Dickinson was awarded the Northeast Conference bid due to Merrimack's ineligibility.

A total of 68 teams participated in the tournament with 32 automatic bids being filled by each program that won its [[List of NCAA conferences#Division I|conference]] tournament. The remaining 36 bids were issued "at-large", with selections extended by the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|NCAA Selection Committee]] on [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Sunday]], March 12.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2023 March Madness: Men's NCAA tournament schedule, dates, times |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2023-02-13/2023-march-madness-mens-ncaa-tournament-schedule-dates-times |publisher=NCAA |date=March 15, 2023 |access-date=2023-02-16 |archive-date=February 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230216103438/https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2023-02-13/2023-march-madness-mens-ncaa-tournament-schedule-dates-times |url-status=live }}</ref> The Selection Committee also [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] the entire field from 1 to 68.

Eight teams (the four-lowest seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the [[First Four]]. The winners of those games advanced to the main tournament [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]].
