The '''2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament''' was a [[single-elimination tournament]] of 68 teams to determine the men's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[college basketball]] national champion for the [[2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2017–18 season]]. The 80th annual edition of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|tournament]] began on March 13, 2018, and concluded with the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 2 at the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]].

During the first round, [[2017–18 UMBC Retrievers men's basketball team|UMBC]] [[2018 UMBC vs. Virginia men's basketball game|became the first 16-seed]] to defeat a 1-seed in the men's tournament by defeating [[2017–18 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|Virginia]] 74–54.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilco|first=Daniel|title=Last perfect bracket busts after UMBC pulls off biggest upset in NCAA tournament history|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/bracketiq/2018-03-17/last-perfect-bracket-busts-after-umbc-pulls-biggest-upset|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|website=NCAA.com|date=March 17, 2018|accessdate=March 17, 2018|quote=UMBC (The University of Maryland Baltimore County) scored the biggest upset in the history of the NCAA tournament, beating top overall seed Virginia 74-54 Friday night, and becoming the first 16 seed to win a game in 136 tries.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bushnell|first=Henry|title=UMBC shocks Virginia, first 16-seed ever to beat a 1|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/umbc-shocks-virginia-first-16-seed-ever-beat-1-033317126.html?soc_trk=gcm&soc_src=d46ec37c-e84f-3cc0-a70b-e3c3763e4e05&.tsrc=notification-brknews|publisher=[[Yahoo Sports]]|date=March 17, 2018|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}</ref> For the first time in tournament history, none of the four top seeded teams in a single region (the South) advanced to the Sweet 16. Also, the tournament featured the first regional final matchup of a 9-seed ([[2017–18 Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team|Kansas State]]) and an 11-seed ([[2017–18 Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team|Loyola-Chicago]]).

[[2017–18 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]], [[2017–18 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]], [[2017–18 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], and [[Loyola-Chicago]], the "[[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella team]]" of the tournament, reached the Final Four. Villanova defeated Michigan in the championship game, 79–62.

[[Atlantic Sun Conference]] champion [[2017–18 Lipscomb Bisons men's basketball team|Lipscomb]] made its NCAA tournament debut.

==Tournament procedure==
{{details|NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament#Current tournament format}}
	
A total of 68 teams entered the 2018 tournament. 32 automatic bids were awarded, one to each program that won their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournament. The remaining 36 bids were "at-large", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.

Eight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2018/3/14/17121546/march-madness-2018-bracket-results-highlights-scores-wednesday-texas-southern-nc-central|title=Syracuse, Texas Southern win in First Four games Wednesday night|last=Moriarty|first=Morgan|date=2018-03-14|website=SBNation.com|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>

'''National Semifinals and Championship''' (Final Four and Championship)
*March 31 and April 2
**[[Alamodome]], [[San Antonio, Texas]] (Host: [[University of Texas at San Antonio]])

For the fourth time, the Alamodome and city of San Antonio are hosting the Final Four. This is the first tournament since [[1994 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1994]] in which no games were played in an [[National Football League|NFL]] stadium, as the Alamodome is a college football stadium, although the Alamodome hosted some home games for the New Orleans Saints during their 2005 season. The 2018 tournament featured three new arenas in previous host cities. Philips Arena, the home of the [[Atlanta Hawks]] and replacement for the previously used [[Omni Coliseum]], hosted the South regional games, and the new Little Caesars Arena, home of the [[Detroit Pistons]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]], hosted games. And for the first time since 1994, the tournament returned to Wichita and the state of Kansas where Intrust Bank Arena hosted first round games.

The state of North Carolina was threatened with a 2018-2022 championship venue boycott by the NCAA, due to the [[Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act|HB2]] law passed in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article140505218.html|title=NCAA gives North Carolina a deadline to repeal HB2 or lose events until 2022|work=newsobserver|access-date=March 18, 2018|language=en}}</ref> However, the law was repealed (but with provisos) days before the NCAA met to make decisions on venues in April 2017. At that time, the NCAA board of governors "reluctantly voted to allow consideration of championship bids in North Carolina by our committees that are presently meeting".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/19186600/north-carolina-hb2-repeal-host-ncaa-tournament-games-2018-2020-2021|title=N.C. gets NCAA tourney sites after HB2 repeal|work=ESPN.com|access-date=March 18, 2018}}</ref> Therefore, Charlotte was eligible and served as a first weekend venue for the 2018 tournament.

==Qualification and selection==
{{details|2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament: qualifying teams}}

Four teams, out of 351 in Division I, were ineligible to participate in the 2018 tournament due to failing to meet [[Academic Progress Rate|APR]] requirements: [[2017–18 Alabama A&M Bulldogs men's basketball team|Alabama A&M]], [[2017–18 Grambling State Tigers men's basketball team|Grambling State]], [[2017–18 Savannah State Tigers men's basketball team|Savannah State]], and [[2017–18 Southeast Missouri State Redhawks men's basketball team|Southeast Missouri State]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Division I teams face penalties, lose postseason|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/division-i-teams-face-penalties-lose-postseason|date=May 10, 2017|publisher=NCAA}}</ref> However, the NCAA granted the Savannah State Tigers a waiver which would have allowed the team to participate in the tournament, but the team failed to qualify.

===Automatic qualifiers===
The following 32 teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2018 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's automatic bid.<ref>{{cite web|title=NCAA conference tournament schedule: Tracking March Madness automatic bids|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2018-03-04/ncaa-conference-tournament-schedule-tracking-march-madness|publisher=NCAA|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref>

*The R64, R32, S16, E8, F4, CG, and NC columns indicate how many teams from each conference were in the round of 64 (first round), round of 32 (second round), Sweet 16, Elite Eight, Final Four, championship game, and national champion, respectively.
*The "Record" column includes wins in the First Four for the ACC, Atlantic 10, Big South, and SWAC conferences and two losses in the First Four for the Pac-12 conference.
*The MEAC and NEC conferences each had one representative, eliminated in the First Four with a record of 0–1.
*The Atlantic Sun, Big Sky, Big West, CAA, Horizon, Ivy League, MAAC, Ohio Valley, Patriot, Southern, Southland, Summit, Sun Belt and WAC conferences each had one representative, eliminated in the First Round with a record of 0–1.

The Pac-12 lost all of its teams after the first day of the main tournament draw, marking the first time since the Big 12 began play in 1996 that one of the six major conferences—defined as the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC, and [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|both]] [[Big East Conference|versions]] of the Big East—failed to have a team advance to the tournament's round of 32.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22785553/ncaa-tournament-fast-unprecedented-fall-pac-12 |title=The fast and unprecedented fall of the Pac-12 |first=Myron |last=Medcalf |website=ESPN.com |date=March 16, 2018 |accessdate=March 16, 2018}}</ref>

==Media coverage==
===Television===
[[CBS Sports]] and [[Turner Sports]] had U.S. television rights to the Tournament under the ''[[NCAA March Madness (CBS/Turner)|NCAA March Madness]]'' brand. As part of a cycle beginning in 2016, TBS held the rights to the Final Four and to the championship game.<ref>{{cite web |title=2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship commentator teams announced |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2018-03-05/2018-ncaa-division-i-mens-basketball-championship-commentator |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=March 5, 2018 |date=February 7, 2018}}</ref> 

For the first time, TBS held the rights to the 2018 Selection Show, which expanded into a two-hour format, was presented in front of a studio audience, and promoted that the entire field of the tournament would be unveiled within the first ten minutes of the broadcast.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/selection-show-tournament-teams-revealed-in-1st-10-minutes/2018/03/06/98632aa8-215d-11e8-946c-9420060cb7bd_story.html |title=Selection show: Tournament teams revealed in 1st 10 minutes |agency=Associated Press |last=Russo  |first=Ralph D. |date=March 6, 2018 |newspaper=Washington Post |access-date=March 12, 2018 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> However, this entailed the 68-team field  (beginning with automatic qualifiers, followed by at-large teams) being revealed in alphabetical order, and not by bracket matchups (which was done later in the show). The new format was criticized for lacking suspense, and the show also faced criticism for technical issues, as well as a segment containing [[product placement]] for [[Pizza Hut]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/college-sports/2018/03/12/tbs-really-made-a-mess-of-the-ncaa-selection-show |title=TBS really made a mess of the NCAA selection show |date=March 12, 2018 |work=Boston.com |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2018/3/11/17107550/2018-selection-show-ncaa-tournament |title=6 ways the NCAA bracket selection show was pretty odd |work=SBNation.com |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/college/mizzou/media-views-ncaa-tourney-selection-show-loses-suspense-adds-immediacy/article_4b202688-4129-55d7-ae24-9ca6883ebcad.html |title=Media Views: NCAA tourney 'Selection Show' loses suspense, adds immediacy |last=Caesar |first=Dan |work=stltoday.com |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref>
