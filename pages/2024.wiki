The '''2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] to determine the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[College basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2023–24 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2023–24 season]]. The 85th annual edition of [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|the tournament]] began on March 19, 2024, and concluded with the [[2023–24 UConn Huskies men's basketball team|UConn Huskies]] successfully defending their title to become the first repeat champion since [[2006–07 Florida Gators men's basketball team|Florida]] in [[2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2007]], defeating the [[2023–24 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Purdue Boilermakers]] 75–60 in the [[2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 8, at [[State Farm Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]].<ref name="Futures-info" />

[[ASUN Conference|ASUN]] champion [[2023–24 Stetson Hatters men's basketball team|Stetson]] and [[Southwestern Athletic Conference|SWAC]] champion [[2023–24 Grambling State Tigers men's basketball team|Grambling State]] made their NCAA tournament debuts. Additionally, [[2023–24 Duquesne Dukes men's basketball team|Duquesne]] made its first appearance since [[1977 NCAA Division I basketball tournament|1977]], [[2023–24 Samford Bulldogs men's basketball team|Samford]] made its first appearance since [[2000 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2000]], [[2023–24 McNeese Cowboys basketball team|McNeese]] made its first appearance since [[2002 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2002]], and [[2023–24 Wagner Seahawks men's basketball team|Wagner]] made its second-ever appearance, its first since [[2003 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2003]].

The first round of the tournament saw the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) struggle, with only three out of the initial eight teams advancing to the next round.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collegesportswire.usatoday.com/lists/sec-basketball-first-round-ncaa-tournament-kentucky-auburn-tennessee/|title=Disaster performance by SEC in first round of 2024 NCAA Tournament|date=March 22, 2024|access-date=April 7, 2024|work=College Sports Wire|author=Patton, Andy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.wtvm.com/2024/03/23/alabama-defeats-charleston-109-96-becomes-third-team-sec-advance-ncaa-tournament/ | title=Alabama defeats Charleston 109-96, becomes third SEC team to advance in NCAA tournament | date=March 23, 2024|author=Collins, Mackenzie|website=wtvm.com}}</ref> Three SEC teams suffered first-round [[#Tournament upsets|upsets]]. On the other hand, the [[Pac-12 Conference]] saw all four of their teams advance to the second round, though [[2023–24 Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team|Arizona]] was the only team in the conference to make the Sweet Sixteen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=March Madness winners and losers: Pac-12 riding high after perfect first round |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2024/03/22/march-madness-first-round-winners-losers-pac-12/73071734007/ |access-date=2024-03-24 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref>

This was the first NCAA tournament since [[2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2019]] to not see a 15-seed defeat a 2-seed. All the 1 and 2-seeds advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, marking only the fifth time it has happened and the first since 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Teresa |last=Walker |title=Houston gives top 8 seeds clean sweep to Sweet 16, holding off Aggies 100-95 |url=https://apnews.com/article/march-madness-houston-aggies-533e8672c7a7ffa2b4e8e67848bcf063 |date=March 25, 2024 |access-date=March 25, 2024 |website=AP |language=en-US}}</ref> Also, with No. 11 seeded [[2023–24 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team|NC State]] advancing to the Sweet Sixteen, this marked the 16th consecutive tournament where a double-digit seed made the regional semifinals. The Wolfpack eventually became the sixth 11-seed to reach the Final Four.

The Final Four consisted of UConn (second consecutive appearance), [[2023–24 Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team|Alabama]] (their first Final Four appearance in program history), NC State (first appearance since [[1983 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1983]]), and Purdue (first appearance since [[1980 NCAA Division I basketball tournament|1980]]).

With No. 1 overall seed UConn winning the championship, this was the first time that the top overall seed won the tournament since [[2011–12 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in [[2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2012]], along with becoming the first defending champion to advance to the Sweet Sixteen since 2016.{{efn-ua|[[2012–13 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]] won the tournament the [[2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|following year]] as the top overall seed; however, their title later was vacated due to a [[2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal|sex scandal]].}}
