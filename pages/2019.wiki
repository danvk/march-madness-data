The '''2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] to determine the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[College basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2018–19 season]]. The 81st annual edition of the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|tournament]] began on March 19, 2019, and concluded with the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 8, at [[U.S. Bank Stadium]] in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], between the [[2018–19 Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball team|Texas Tech Red Raiders]] and the [[2018–19 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|Virginia Cavaliers]], with Virginia winning 85–77 in overtime.<ref>{{cite news |last=Prather |first=Shannon |url=http://www.startribune.com/plans-for-2019-ncaa-final-four-already-underway/462596113/ |title=Plans for 2019 NCAA Final Four are underway |work=[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]] |access-date=2017-12-08|date=December 7, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=March Madness 2019 dates and schedule |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/march-madness-dates-tournament-schedule |publisher=NCAA |access-date=March 10, 2019 |date=March 7, 2019 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Two schools made their first appearances in the tournament: [[2019 Big South Conference men's basketball tournament|Big South]] champion [[2018–19 Gardner–Webb Runnin' Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gardner–Webb]] and [[2019 Southland Conference men's basketball tournament|Southland]] champion [[2018–19 Abilene Christian Wildcats men's basketball team|Abilene Christian]].

For the first time since [[2001 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2001]] (also hosted in Minneapolis), no #8 seed survived the first round of the tournament. This was also the first time since the [[First Four]] was established in [[2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2011]] that no team in the First Four advanced past the first round of the tournament.{{efn|This remains the only such instance in the men's tournament. However, the [[NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament|D-I women's tournament]] added its own First Four when it expanded to 68 teams in [[2022 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament|2022]], and no First Four winner in that tournament advanced beyond the first round.}} This was the first Final Four since 2012 that did not include at least one team seeded #7 or lower.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-05-11/2013-ncaa-tournament-bracket-scores-stats-records|title=2013 NCAA tournament: Bracket, scores, stats, records &#124; NCAA.com|website=ncaa.com|access-date=June 25, 2023}}</ref>

This tournament marked the first time that the [[2018–19 Auburn Tigers men's basketball team|Auburn Tigers]] of the [[Southeastern Conference]] and the [[2018–19 Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball team|Texas Tech Red Raiders]] of the [[Big 12 Conference]] made the Final Four. This also marked the third Final Four appearance for the [[2018–19 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|Virginia Cavaliers]] of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], but their first [[1983–84 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|since]] [[1984 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1984]].

The championship game was the first time since [[1979 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1979]] to see two first-time participants playing in the championship, and the first since [[2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2006]] to have a first-time national champion.<ref>{{cite web |title=First time finalists meet |first = Ralph D. |last = Russo|url=https://chippewa.com/first-time-finalists-meet/article_97590692-ae7e-555c-a8a9-cf6c5a635895.html |work = The Chippewa Herald |date=7 April 2019 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> As a result of a worldwide [[COVID-19 pandemic]] that started in late 2019 and subsequently forced the cancellation of the [[2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2020 tournament]], this would be the last tournament held until [[2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2021]], and this would be also the last tournament held across the United States until [[2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2022]].

[[Carsen Edwards]] of [[2018–19 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Purdue]] was the leading scorer, with 139 points in only 4 games—producing an average of 34.8 points per game. Edwards also set the record for most made [[Three-point field goal|three-point shots]] in a tournament, with 28. The previous record holder, [[Glen Rice]] of [[1988–89 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] in [[1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1989]], made 27, but did so in 6 games.

In the previous year's tournament, [[2017–18 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|Virginia]] had [[2018 UMBC vs. Virginia men's basketball game|infamously become the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed.]] At the conclusion of this year's title game, CBS announcer [[Jim Nantz]] dubbed Virginia's win the "all-time turnaround title."<ref>{{cite web |last=Schuknecht |first=Cat |date=9 April 2019 |title='This Is A Great Story', Says Virginia Cavaliers' Coach On Team's NCAA Comeback |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711302804/this-is-a-great-story-says-virginia-cavaliers-coach-on-team-s-ncaa-comeback |access-date=11 April 2019 |website=npr.org}}</ref>

==Tournament procedure==
{{further|NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship#Tournament format}}

A total of 68 teams entered the 2019 tournament. Thirty-two automatic bids were awarded to each program that won their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]]'s tournament. The remaining 36 bids were "at-large", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.

Eight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as "[[First Four|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.

The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.

The selections and seedings were completed and revealed on Sunday, March 17.

==Media coverage==

===Television===
[[CBS Sports]] and [[Turner Sports]] (via [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[truTV]]) had U.S. television rights to the tournament.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turner Sports and CBS Sports Announce 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Commentator Teams |url=https://www.turner.com/pressroom/turner-sports-and-cbs-sports-announce-2019-ncaa-division-i-men’s-basketball-championship |publisher=Turner Broadcasting |access-date=11 March 2019 |date=11 March 2019 |df=mdy-all }}{{Dead link|date=June 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As part of a cycle than began in 2016, CBS televised the 2019 Final Four and championship game.

In response to criticism over TBS's handling of the selection show in 2018 (which featured an unconventional two-hour format where all the qualifying teams were first revealed in alphabetical order before the matchups were actually unveiled, and had viewership fall by 52% partly due to it also being aired on cable rather than CBS), it was announced that CBS's selection show would revert to an hour-long format, and prioritize unveiling the bracket. [[CNN]] president [[Jeff Zucker]], who had also become head of WarnerMedia's sports properties after a reorganization, explained that "it's a sign of understanding when things don't necessarily go as well as you would hope you change it. So there's no shame in that. At the end of the day, you have to give the fans what they want."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Strauss |first=Ben |date=March 12, 2019 |title=After backlash, the NCAA tournament selection show is going back to basics |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/03/12/after-backlash-ncaa-tournament-selection-show-is-going-back-basics |access-date=March 12, 2019 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref> The show attracted its highest viewership since 2014 and averaged a 4.0 share on Nielsen overnight ratings.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-spt-cbs-ncaa-tournament-selection-show-ratings-20190318-story.html |title=CBS' streamlined NCAA 'Selection Show' scores best overnight ratings in 5 years |last=Rosenthal |first=Phil |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=March 18, 2019 |access-date=2019-03-19 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>
