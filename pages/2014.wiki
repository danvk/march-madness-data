The '''2014 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 64 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] to determine the national champion of men's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 18, 2014, and concluded with the [[2013–14 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|Connecticut Huskies]] winning the [[2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 7 at [[AT&T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]].

The East Regional semifinals and final were held in [[Madison Square Garden]], the first time that arena has been used as an NCAA Tournament venue and the first time in 63 years that tournament games have been held in New York City.

With No. 7 seed [[2013-14 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|Connecticut]] and No. 8 seed [[2013-14 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] reaching the championship game, this tournament's final was the first ever not to include at least one 1, 2, or 3 seed. It is also only the third final not to feature a 1 or 2 seed ([[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]] - #3 [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] vs. #3 [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall]] and [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|2011]] - #3 [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]] vs. #8 [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]]). Connecticut was the first 7 seed ever to reach and win the championship game. The two teams combined for the highest seed total in championship game history with 15. The previous record (11) was held by Connecticut and Butler in 2011.

The next day, the [[Connecticut Huskies women's basketball|UConn Huskies women's team]] won the [[2014 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|women's NCAA basketball tournament]], only the second time that a school has won both the men's and women's Division I national basketball championships in the same year; UConn first accomplished this in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament/2014/story/_/id/10753064/connecticut-huskies-welcome-home-men-champions-celebrate-women-title |title=Party continues with title sweep |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=April 9, 2014}}</ref>

The previous season, UConn was academically ineligible for the postseason.

==Tournament procedure==
{{details|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Current tournament format}}

For 2014 the selection committee picked a total of 68 teams that would enter the 2014 tournament, of which 32 were "automatic bids" (teams winning their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments, with the exception of the [[Ivy League]], which does not host a post-season conference tournament; thus, its regular-season conference champion is awarded the automatic bid) while the remaining 36 were "at large" bids which were extended by the NCAA Selection Committee on the Sunday preceding the First Four play-in tournament and dubbed ''[[NCAA basketball tournament selection process#Selection Sunday|Selection Sunday]]'' by the media and fans.  The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.<ref>http://www.marchmadness2014.net/betting-system-a-few-simple-tips-for-betting-on-the-ncaa-tournament/</ref>

Eight teams – the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams – played in the ''First Four'' (the successor to what had been popularly known as "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament).  The winners of those games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.

==Notables==
[[2013–14 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|Wichita State]] became the first team since UNLV in 1991 to go into the tournament undefeated. The Shockers entered the tournament 34-0. Their perfect record of 35-0 (a then NCAA men's record) would be spoiled by [[2013-14 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in the third round. Kentucky would set an NCAA-men's-record 38 straight wins to start a season the next year.

For only the second time since 1973 no teams from the state of Indiana (a state noted for its basketball powerhouse programs) were in the tournament.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/sports/ncaabasketball/for-indiana-land-of-hoops-no-shot-in-ncaa-tournament.html?_r=0 |title=For Land of Hoops, No Shot in N.C.A.A. Tournament t|accessdate=March 17, 2014 |date=March 16, 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |last=Macur |first=Juliet}}</ref>

There were five overtime games in the Second Round of the tournament, the most overtime games ever in tournament history. In contrast, the previous two tournaments had two overtime games '''''combined'''''.

[[2013–14 North Dakota State Bison men's basketball team|North Dakota State]]'s victory against [[2013–14 Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team|Oklahoma]] secured the first tournament win for the state of [[North Dakota]]. [[2013–14 Mercer Bears men's basketball team|Mercer]], [[2013–14 Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks basketball team|Stephen F. Austin]], [[2013–14 Albany Great Danes men's basketball team|Albany]], and Cal Poly had their first NCAA tournament wins. Cal Poly's victory over Texas Southern marked only the third time a team with a losing record won a game in the tournament.

Notable upsets included: Mercer over Duke; Dayton over Ohio State and, later, over Syracuse; North Dakota State over Oklahoma; Stephen F. Austin over VCU; Harvard over Cincinnati (its second-consecutive upset in as many years as a #12 seed); Stanford over Kansas; Kentucky over previously unbeaten Wichita State and, later, over Michigan; and UConn over Villanova and, later, over #1 overall seed Florida.

The National Championship game is the first one not to involve a 1, 2, or a 3 seed, and featured the two lowest seeds ever to meet (#7 UConn and #8 Kentucky).  UConn was the first #7 seed to reach, and win, the championship game.

The city of Arlington became the 29th individual host city, and the AT&T Stadium became the 38th host venue, for the Final Four. The tournament featured three new venues in cities that had previously hosted tournament games. For the first time, games were played at the fourth Madison Square Garden, marking the first time in [[Manhattan]] since 1961 (when it was played at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|the previous Garden]]), and the first time in any borough of New York City since being played at [[Carnesecca Arena|Alumni Hall]] on the campus of [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] in [[Queens]] in 1974. The tournament also returned to Orlando for the first time since 2004, playing for the first time at the Amalie Center, the arena that replaced the former [[Amway Arena]]. And for the first time, the tournament was played at the AT&T Center, San Antonio's home to the [[San Antonio Spurs|Spurs]]. As of 2018, this marks the most recent time the tournament has been played at either the AT&T Stadium or the AT&T Center, with the latter scheduled to host games again in 2022.
