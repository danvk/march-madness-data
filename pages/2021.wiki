The '''2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' was a [[single-elimination tournament]] of 68 teams to determine the [[NCAA|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[college basketball]] national champion for the [[2020–21 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2020–21 season]]. The 82nd edition of [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|the tournament]] began play on March 18, 2021, in sites around the state of [[Indiana]],<ref>{{cite news |title=NCAA announces dates for preliminary March Madness rounds |url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/30743037/ncaa-announces-dates-preliminary-march-madness-rounds |access-date=January 19, 2021 |work=ESPN.com |date=January 19, 2021}}</ref> and concluded with the [[2021 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in [[Indianapolis]] on April 5, with the [[2020–21 Baylor Bears basketball team|Baylor Bears]] defeating the previously undefeated [[2020–21 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gonzaga Bulldogs]] 86–70 to earn the team's first ever title.

For logistical considerations surrounding the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]] (which resulted in the cancellation of the [[2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|previous year's tournament]]), the NCAA announced in January 2021 that all tournament games would be held in Indiana rather than at sites across the country. This was the only time in the history of the tournament to date that a single state has hosted it in its entirety.<ref name="indiana">{{cite web |title=NCAA announces further details for 2021 Division I men's basketball championship |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2021-01-04/ncaa-announces-further-details-2021-division-i-mens-basketball-championship |access-date=January 4, 2021}}</ref>

This marked the first time since [[1976 NCAA Division I basketball tournament|1976]] that neither [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] or [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] qualified for the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gonzaga, Baylor, Illinois, Michigan get top seeds in NCAA men's basketball tournament|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/31066148/gonzaga-baylor-illinois-michigan-get-top-seeds-ncaa-men-basketball-tournament|work=ESPN.com|access-date=March 14, 2021|date=March 14, 2021}}</ref> It was also the first time since [[1995 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1995]] that Duke failed to make the tournament, breaking a streak of 24 consecutive appearances. [[America East Conference|America East]] champion [[2020–21 Hartford Hawks men's basketball team|Hartford]] and [[Western Athletic Conference|WAC]] champion [[2020–21 Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball team|Grand Canyon]] made their NCAA Tournament debuts.

The tournament was marked by many upsets, with [[Yahoo Sports]] journalist [[Pete Thamel]] calling it "one of the most dizzying NCAA men's tournaments in history". With only half of the 16 second-round games having been played, there had been 11 upsets to that point, using the NCAA's definition of "upset" as a win by a team [[seed (sports)|seeded]] five or more lines below its defeated opponent. This had already broken the record for most upsets prior to the round of 16; by the end of the second round, this number went up to 12. In addition, at least one team seeded #9 through #15 won a first-round game for the fourth time ever, and the first time since [[2016 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2016]]. Also, a record four teams seeded 13 or lower won first-round games.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/why-this-may-already-be-the-wildest-ncaa-mens-tournament-ever-061712534.html |title=Why this may already be the craziest NCAA men's tournament ever |first=Pete |last=Thamel |author-link=Pete Thamel |website=[[Yahoo Sports]] |date=March 22, 2021 |access-date=March 22, 2021}}</ref> Another notable mark set during the tournament was a record-breaking 14 upsets throughout the event, breaking the original record of 13 upsets from the [[1985 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1985]] and [[2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2014]] tournaments.

The Final Four game between UCLA and Gonzaga (the first semifinal game to go into overtime since [[1998 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1998]]) saw a game-winning buzzer-beater by [[Jalen Suggs]] to take Gonzaga into the championship game, the first buzzer-beater in a national semifinal since [[1977 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1977]]. By defeating Gonzaga [[2021 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|in the championship game]], the [[Baylor Bears basketball|Baylor Bears]] became the second consecutive first-time NCAA champions, following the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia Cavaliers]] in [[2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2019]]. The last time this happened was in [[2002 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2002]] and [[2003 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2003]], when the [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland Terrapins]] and [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse Orange]] (then nicknamed Orangemen) won their first titles in their respective years. Baylor also joined [[1965–66 Texas Western Miners men's basketball team|Texas Western]] (now known as the [[University of Texas at El Paso]]) as the only two teams from the state of Texas to have won an NCAA Division I Basketball championship, the Miners having done so in [[1966 NCAA University Division basketball tournament|1966]].

==Tournament procedure==
{{further|NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament#Current tournament format}}
	
A total of 68 teams entered the 2021 tournament, with 31 of them (down from 32, due to the [[Ivy League]] having canceled all winter semester sports due to COVID-19)<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ivy League cancels basketball season for 2020-21 as part of ban on winter sports due to COVID-19|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ivy-league-cancels-basketball-season-for-2020-21-as-part-of-ban-on-winter-sports-due-to-covid-19/|access-date=November 15, 2020|website=CBSSports.com|date=November 12, 2020 }}</ref> having received an automatic bid by winning their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference's]] tournament. The remaining 37 bids were "at-large", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Teams met sport sponsorship requirements and were considered for NCAA championship selection if they played 13 games, which represented a 50 percent reduction of the current minimum. For NCAA championship consideration, all 13 games had to be against other Division I opponents. Teams could also play 12 regular-season games against Division I opponents and one conference tournament game to be eligible for tournament consideration.<ref>{{cite web|title=DI Council approves Nov. 25 start date for men's and women's basketball|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/di-council-approves-nov-25-start-date-men-s-and-women-s-basketball|date=September 16, 2020|publisher=[[NCAA]]}}</ref>

The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 68. The four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams played in the [[First Four]] round: for the 2021 tournament, the games were played between the overall 65th and 66th seeds, the 67th and 68th seed, and the last four at-large seeds.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New bracketing principles adopted for 2021 NCAA tournament|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2021-01-15/new-bracketing-principles-adopted-2021ncaa-tournament|access-date=2021-03-08|website=NCAA.com|language=en}}</ref>

The top four teams outside of the ranking (commonly known as the "first four out" in pre-tourney analyses) acted as standbys in the event a school was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to COVID-19 protocols.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gleeson|first=Scott|date=March 14, 2021|title=March Madness: Here's how Duke could play in the 2021 NCAA Tournament after all|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2021/03/14/march-madness-heres-how-duke-could-play-ncaa-tournament/4687883001/|access-date=March 14, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gleeson|first1=Scott|last2=Mast|first2=Shelby|date=March 14, 2021|title=NCAA Tournament bracketology: Final March Madness projection on Selection Sunday|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/ncaab/2021/03/14/march-madness-bracketology-final-ncaa-tournament-field/4686838001/|access-date=March 14, 2021}}</ref> However, if a team withdrew within 48 hours of the tournament's commencement, they would not be replaced; the bracket was not reseeded, and the affected team's opponent would [[walkover|automatically advance]] to the next round.

On January 4, 2021, the NCAA announced that due to logistical considerations associated with the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]] (which prompted the cancellation of the 2020 tournament), the entirety of the tournament would be conducted at sites  within the [[Indianapolis metropolitan area|Indianapolis metro area]] and [[Geography of Indiana#Central Indiana|central Indiana]], rather than across the country.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-01-04|title=NCAA men's basketball tournament to be played entirely in Indiana|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/30650595/ncaa-men-basketball-tournament-played-entirely-indiana|access-date=2021-04-07|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> Players stayed at hotels near the [[Indiana Convention Center]], which served as the main practice facility.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last1=Benbow|first1=Dana Hunsinger|last2=Doyel|first2=Gregg|last3=Osterman|first3=Zach|title=It's official: 2021 NCAA tournament to be played entirely in Central Indiana, Indianapolis|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/college/2021/01/04/2021-march-madness-played-entirely-indianapolis-central-indiana/4124594001/|access-date=February 22, 2021|work=The Indianapolis Star}}</ref> Lucas Oil Stadium had two courts named "Unity Court" and "Equality Court" during the First Round, Second Round, and Elite Eight.

===<span id="RegionSeeds">Tournament seeds</span>===
<section begin="RegionSeeds" />
The tournament seeds and regions were determined through the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process]].

In contrast to previous years, the S-Curve used to establish overall seeds will also be used as primary determinant of the tournament bracket; this was made possible by the relatively condensed locations of this year's tournament making geographic concerns irrelevant. However, rules that can modify pairings to avoid early rematches and to distribute top conference representatives to different regions will remain in effect.<ref>{{cite web |title=New bracketing principles adopted for 2021 NCAA tournament|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2021-01-15/new-bracketing-principles-adopted-2021ncaa-tournament |website=www.ncaa.com |publisher=NCAA |access-date=March 6, 2021 |date=January 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The NCAA bracket S-curve, explained|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2021-01-15/ncaa-bracket-s-curve-explained |website=www.ncaa.com |publisher=NCAA |access-date=March 6, 2021 |date=January 15, 2021}}</ref>

===First Four===
The [[First Four]] games involved eight teams: the four overall lowest-ranked teams, and the four lowest-ranked at-large teams.
