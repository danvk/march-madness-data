The '''2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that determined the  [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[college basketball]] national champion for the [[2021–22 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2021–22 season]]. The 83rd annual edition of [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|the tournament]] began on March 15, 2022, and concluded with the [[2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 4 at the [[Caesars Superdome]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], with the [[2021–22 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas Jayhawks]] defeating the [[2021-22 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina Tar Heels]], 72–69, overcoming a 16-point first-half deficit (the largest deficit overcome in championship game history), to claim the school's fourth national title.

[[Big South Conference]] champion [[2021–22 Longwood Lancers men's basketball team|Longwood]] and [[Northeast Conference]] (NEC) champion [[2021–22 Bryant Bulldogs men's basketball team|Bryant]] made their tournament debuts. Bryant was eliminated in the First Four by [[2021–22 Wright State Raiders men's basketball team|Wright State]], and Longwood was eliminated by [[2021–22 Tennessee Volunteers basketball team|Tennessee]] in the first round.

A major upset occurred on the first full day of the tournament, when 15-seed [[2021–22 Saint Peter's Peacocks men's basketball team|Saint Peter's]] upset 2-seed [[2021–22 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], and subsequently became the third 15-seed to reach the Sweet 16 (the second consecutive year in which this occurred and third in the last nine years) and the first ever 15-seed to advance to the Elite Eight.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bushnell |first=Henry |date=March 17, 2022 |title=Kentucky stunned by No. 15 seed Saint Peter's, a new March Madness low for John Calipari |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/kentucky-saint-peters-upset-march-madness-014205235.html |access-date=March 17, 2022 |website=[[Yahoo! Sports]]}}</ref> This was the tenth time a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed overall, but it was the sixth time since 2012 this occurred. The defending champions [[2021–22 Baylor Bears men's basketball team|Baylor]] were defeated by [[2021–22 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] in the second round, ensuring the defending champion and at least one top seed was eliminated before the regional semifinals for the fifth consecutive tournament, and at least one double-digit seed (this year, four: 15-seed Saint Peter's, 11-seeds [[2021–22 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] and [[2021–22 Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team|Iowa State]], and 10-seed [[2021–22 Miami Hurricanes men's basketball team|Miami]]) made the Sweet 16 for the 14th straight tournament.

==Tournament procedure==
{{further|NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament#Current tournament format}}

A total of 68 teams were entered into the 2022 tournament. A total of 32 automatic bids were awarded to each program that won a [[List of NCAA conferences#Division I|conference]] tournament (with one exception, as the [[2021–22 Bellarmine Knights men's basketball team|tournament winner]] in the ASUN Conference was ineligible, due to its transition from Division II). The remaining 36 bids were issued "at-large", with selections extended by the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|NCAA Selection Committee]]. The Selection Committee also [[Seed (sports)|seed]]ed the entire field from 1 to 68.
 
Eight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the [[First Four]]. The winners of these games advanced to the main [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]] of the tournament.

The top four teams outside of the ranking (commonly known as the "first four out" in pre-tournament analyses) acted as standbys in the event a school was forced to withdraw before the start of the tournament due to COVID-19 protocols. Any recipient of an automatic bid would designate a replacement from within their own conference if they need to withdraw. Otherwise, the replacement teams were as follows, in order:

Once the tournament started, any team that would have been forced to withdraw would not be replaced; the bracket would not be reseeded, and the affected team's opponent would [[walkover|automatically advance]] to the next round.
