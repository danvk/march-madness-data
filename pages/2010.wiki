The '''2010 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]''' involved 65 schools playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I [[college basketball]] as a culmination of the [[2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2009–10 basketball season]]. It began on March 16, 2010, and concluded with the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 5 at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in [[Indianapolis]]. It was the first [[Final Four]] at Lucas Oil Stadium; the [[RCA Dome]] and [[Market Square Arena]] hosted past Final Fours when the event was held in Indianapolis.

The Final Four consisted of [[2009–10 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]], making their first appearance since [[2004 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2004]], [[2009–10 West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball team|West Virginia]], who were making their second appearance and first since [[1959 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1959]], [[2009–10 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team|Butler]], considered the host school and making their first ever appearance, and [[2009–10 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]], the national runner-up from [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2009]] appearing in the Final Four for the sixth time under head coach [[Tom Izzo]].

When Duke and Butler played each other in the tournament final, it was the first title game between private universities in 25 years ([[1984–85 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] and [[1984–85 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] met in [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1985]]), and the fifth such match-up in history ([[1942 NCAA Basketball Tournament|1942]], [[1954 NCAA Basketball Tournament|1954]], and [[1955 NCAA Basketball Tournament|1955]] having been the other years).

Duke defeated Butler 61–59 in the championship game as [[Gordon Hayward]]'s last second desperation shot clanged off the rim. It was Duke's first national championship since [[2001 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2001]] and fourth overall.

Entering the tournament, the top four seeds were [[2009–10 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], Duke, [[2009–10 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], and [[2009–10 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]]. Kansas entered the Tournament as the overall No. 1 seed but was defeated on opening weekend by [[2009–10 Northern Iowa Panthers men's basketball team|Northern Iowa]], the No. 9 seed in the Midwest region. Northern Iowa was one of four teams seeded lower than No. 8 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, joining the East Region's No. 11 seed [[2009–10 Washington Huskies men's basketball team|Washington]] and No. 12 seed [[2009–10 Cornell Big Red men's basketball team|Cornell]] and the South Region's No. 10 seed [[2009–10 Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball team|Saint Mary's]].

For the first time since [[2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2006]], a No. 14 seed advanced out of the First Round as [[Ohio Bobcats men's basketball|Ohio]] defeated [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]]. The No. 13 seed in the West Region, [[Murray State Racers men's basketball|Murray State]], defeated No. 4-seeded [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt]], marking the second consecutive appearance for the Commodores where they lost as a No. 4 seed. Murray State very nearly upset Butler in their next game, losing by two points.

One of the more exciting games of the tournament was played at the West Regional in [[Salt Lake City]], as No. 6 [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] took No. 2 [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]] to two overtimes before falling 101–96. [[Jordan Crawford]] hit a three-pointer with seconds remaining in the first overtime period to force a second.

A total of 65 teams were selected for the tournament. Thirty one of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments. The automatic bid of the [[Ivy League]], which does not conduct a postseason tournament, went to [[2009–10 Cornell Big Red men's basketball team|Cornell]], its regular season champion. The remaining 34 teams were granted at-large bids, which were extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.

Two teams played an opening-round game, popularly called the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round Game|play-in game]]; the winner of that game advanced to the main draw of the tournament and played a top seed in one of the regionals. The 2010 game was played on March 16 at [[University of Dayton Arena]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio, as it has been since its inception in [[2001 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2001]].

All 64 teams were seeded 1 to 16 within their regions; the winner of the play-in game automatically received a 16 seed. The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 65. [[UCLA Bruins|UCLA]] athletic director [[Dan Guerrero]] took over as chair of the Division I Men's Basketball Committee.<ref>NCAA News: [https://www.ncaa.org/wps/ncaa?key=/ncaa/ncaa/ncaa+news/ncaa+news+online/2009/division+i/smith+to+chair+division+i+mens+basketball+committee+_06_30_2009_+ncaa+news Smith to chair Division I Men's Basketball Committee], June 30, 2009</ref>

Defending champion [[2009–10 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] did not qualify for the Tournament, while two schools made their first post-season appearance: [[Southern Conference]] champion [[2009–10 Wofford Terriers men's basketball team|Wofford]] and [[Southwestern Athletic Conference|SWAC]] champion [[Arkansas–Pine Bluff Golden Lions men's basketball|Arkansas-Pine Bluff]]. [[Conference USA]] champion [[2009–10 Houston Cougars men's basketball team|Houston]] made its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 18 years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Steve|title=Cougars say: 'Let's dance'|work=Houston Chronicle|date=March 13, 2010|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/college/houston/6911792.html|accessdate=April 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100317205800/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/college/houston/6911792.html| archivedate= 17 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

With Butler's win in the West Regional final, this marked the first time since [[1972 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1972]] that the host city had a home team in the Final Four (when [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] went) and the first time that a host school played in the Final Four since [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] did so in [[1959 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1959]]. There was only one new arena in the 2010 tournament, as Salt Lake City's EnergySolutions Arena, the home of the NBA's [[Utah Jazz]], hosted for the first time; previous tournaments in the city were held on the campus of the [[University of Utah]] at either [[Nielsen Fieldhouse]] or the [[Jon M. Huntsman Center]]. All fourteen venues used in the 2010 tournament have hosted games since.

====First round====
The biggest upset of the first day came in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island, where 14th-seeded [[2009–10 Ohio Bobcats men's basketball team|Ohio]] defeated third-seeded [[2009–10 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] in convincing fashion, 97–83, for their first Tournament win since [[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1983]], when they ousted [[Illinois State Redbirds men's basketball|Illinois State]] in the First Round of that Tournament.

====Second round====
Northern Iowa stunned the nation by knocking off top overall seed Kansas, 69–67. Leading by just one in the final minute of play, Ali Farokhmanesh clinched the victory for the second time in as many games with a three-point basket that [[ESPN]]'s [[Pat Forde]] called "the greatest early-round shot in NCAA tournament history."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/tournament/2010/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&id=5020760 |title=Tourney's early winners and losers |first=Pat |last=Forde |publisher=ESPN.com |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |quote=Consider this argument for why it should go down as the greatest early-round shot in NCAA tournament history...

On April 5, 2010, [[2009–10 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team|Butler]] and [[2009–10 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] faced off in what ''The New York Times'' called "the most eagerly awaited championship game in years".<ref>{{cite news|title=Once the Underdog, Duke Is Now the Villain|author=William C.

Butler became the first team to play in the championship game in its home city since UCLA in 1968.

Duke jumped out to a quick 6–1 lead to start the game, but Butler rallied back, taking a 12–11 lead at the 12:28 mark of the first half. At the under eight-minute TV timeout, Butler held a 20–18 lead.  After the timeout, Duke went on an 8–0 run to take a 26–20 lead. Butler coach [[Brad Stevens]] then called a timeout. With starters [[Matt Howard (basketball)|Matt Howard]] and Ronald Nored on the bench in foul trouble, backup center Avery Jukes came up big for Butler. Jukes hit two three-pointers and a made tip-in en route to 10 first half points, tying his single-game season high. At half time, Duke's lead stood at 33–32.<ref name="champs">{{cite news|title=Duke downs Butler to clinch fourth national title|date=April 5, 2010|publisher=CBSSports.com wire reports|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20100405_BUT@DUKE?tag=scores-1744022;links1744022|accessdate=April 6, 2010}}</ref>

The second half was played very closely, with neither team taking a lead larger than two points until a [[Brian Zoubek]] layup put Duke up 47–43 with 12:27 remaining. Butler stayed close, keeping within 5 points the rest of the way. With 3:16 to play, Duke took a 60–55 lead on two made free throws by [[Nolan Smith]]. Butler missed its next shot, but forced a missed shot and turned Duke over after an offensive rebound. Matt Howard made a layup for Butler to make it a 60–57 game with 1:44 remaining. Smith missed a layup for Duke and Howard got another layup after collecting an offensive rebound on a missed three-pointer by [[Shelvin Mack]]. Duke coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]] then called a time out. [[Kyle Singler]] missed an open jump shot with 36 seconds remaining, giving Butler a chance to take the lead. Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a timeout to set up a play. They were then forced to call their last timeout when they were unable to get the ball in-bounds. [[Gordon Hayward]] then missed a short fade-away jumper. Zoubek came down with the rebound, forcing Butler to foul with 3.6 seconds remaining. Zoubek made the first foul shot and then intentionally missed the second, knowing Butler had no timeouts remaining. Hayward was forced to throw up a desperation shot from half court. The ball bounced off the backboard and then the rim.<ref name="champs" /> According to analysis by ESPN, Hayward's aim was off by three inches, or less than one degree, on the x-axis.<ref>{{cite video|title=Video: Sport Science on Butler's last shot|date=April 7, 2010|work=ESPN|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/10413/video-sport-science-on-butlers-last-shot|accessdate=April 7, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100409225329/http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/10413/video-sport-science-on-butlers-last-shot| archivedate= 9 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Because a made three-point shot would have resulted in a loss for Duke, some pundits criticized Krzyzewski for his decision to have Zoubek miss the second free throw intentionally.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} Other pundits, however, ran various analyses that indicated that it was statistically the correct call.<ref>{{cite news|title=Duke vs. Butler: The Math Behind the Zoubek Free Throw Decision|author= Chuck Allen|date=April 12, 2010|work=Bleacher Report|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/377390-duke-vs-butler-the-math-behind-the-zoubek-free-throw-decision|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}</ref>

For the 29th consecutive year, [[College Basketball on CBS|CBS Sports]] again televised a majority of the event, with the exception of the opening round game, which was televised by [[ESPN]], and first-round games played in the late afternoon, which [[CBS College Sports Network]] aired so CBS affiliates could break for local and [[CBS Evening News|network news]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collegehoopsnet.com/2010-ncaa-tournament-cbs-tv-schedule-168212 |title=2010 NCAA Tournament: CBS TV Schedule|accessdate=March 9, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100222071357/http://www.collegehoopsnet.com/2010-ncaa-tournament-cbs-tv-schedule-168212| archivedate= 22 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The championship game scored a [[ACNielson|Nielson]] rating of 16.0.

In addition to the main CBS affiliates, many stations opened [[digital subchannel]]s for additional coverage.  Also, on these four occasions, CBS opened the coverage to additional channels to settle conflicts:
*On March 26, during the regional semifinals, [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], Indiana affiliate [[WSBT-TV]] aired the Purdue-Duke telecast, while its digital subchannel, [[independent station]] SBT2, carried Michigan State vs. Northern Iowa.  Part of the South Bend market (including the city of [[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]]) is located within the state of Michigan.
*On March 25, also within the Sweet 16, the game between Xavier and Kansas State was seen on [[WKRC-TV]] and the game between Kentucky and Cornell was seen on [[WKRC-DT2]], also known as "The [[The CW Television Network|CW]] Cincinnati", at the same time.  Xavier is located in the city of Cincinnati, while much of the [[Template:Cincy TV|Cincinnati DMA]] is located within the state of Kentucky. The fan and alumni bases for the University of Kentucky are substantial in the Cincinnati area, and the Wildcats play occasional home games at [[U.S. Bank Arena]].
*On March 19, the first-round game between Clemson and Missouri was shown on [[WSPA-TV]] while the game between Wofford and Wisconsin was on [[WYCW]] at the same time.  Both Clemson and Wofford are located in the [[Upstate South Carolina|upstate area]] of South Carolina.
*On March 18, the first-round game between North Texas and Kansas State was seen on [[KTVT]], while at the same time Baylor vs. Sam Houston State was shown on [[KTXA]].  UNT is in the [[Template:Dallas-Fort Worth TV|Dallas/Fort Worth media market]] ([[Denton, Texas|Denton]], Texas); [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], Texas, where Baylor is located, is in [[Template:Waco TV|a separate DMA]].  However, some DFW stations are available via [[cable television|cable TV]] in Waco, and it is believed that more alumni of BU live in the Metroplex than anywhere else.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} (For similar reasons, KTVT agreed to air the late-afternoon Texas A&M vs. Utah State game on 3/19 after earlier planning not to do so.){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

WSPA and WYCW are in a duopoly owned by [[Media General]], and KTVT and KTXA are in a duopoly owned by [[CBS Corporation]].

==Courts==
After experimenting with custom-made courts during the previous year's tournament, the NCAA began importing custom-made identical portable courts and [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] backboard supports (if needed) to all tournament sites in 2010. The custom court began with the [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986 Final Four]] and was expanded for identical courts in [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007]] for the regional semi-final and final round sites, before being used for all sites starting in 2010.
